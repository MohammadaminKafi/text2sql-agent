# Text2SQL Agent

This project is focused on developing a high-performance Text2SQL agent designed for large-scale and multi-database systems. It uses advanced techniques such as:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ReAct agent architecture
- Multi-agent coordination

## Based on Vanna

This project builds on top of core utilities from the [Vanna project](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna), which provides foundational components for natural language to SQL interfaces.
